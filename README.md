noVNC Rails Gem
===============

This gem is an attempt to make noVNC easy to install in a Rails application.

So far, it's fairly primordial, in that I just copied the assets in
and changed a few things by hand.  Having got everything working, the
next step will be to automate the process, and perhaps create
something to make the HTML code available.

The original noVNC is available here: http://kanaka.github.com/noVNC/
